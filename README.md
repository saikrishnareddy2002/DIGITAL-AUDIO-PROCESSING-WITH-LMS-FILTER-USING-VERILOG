# DIGITAL-AUDIO-PROCESSING-WITH-LMS-FILTER-USING-VERILOG

ABSTRACT          
 Digital audio processing is a critical facet of contemporary communication systems, entertainment, and various applications where audio quality holds paramount importance. This research introduces an innovative approach to digital audio processing by incorporating the Least Mean Squares (LMS) Filter. The project involves a comprehensive pipeline, starting with the conversion of an audio input to a hexadecimal file, followed by real-time LMS filtering implemented in Verilog. The final stage involves the conversion of the filtered output back to an audio file. The study evaluates the performance of the LMS filter in noise reduction and overall audio enhancement. The abstract serves as a concise yet comprehensive overview of the research, highlighting the unique contributions and expected outcomes. The integration of Python and Verilog technologies in this project showcases a comprehensive methodology for audio signal processing. The seamless interoperability of these languages allows for efficient and modular development, combining the high-level expressiveness of Python with the hardware-level control and performance of Verilog. The project's modular design facilitates scalability and adaptability for various audio processing applications. Overall, this research contributes to the broader field of digital signal processing, offering a flexible and efficient solution for audio data manipulation.
