Introduction of the Least Mean Squares (LMS) Filter:

In response to the challenges posed by existing systems, this research introduces an innovative approach by incorporating the Least Mean Squares (LMS) Filter. The LMS Filter offers a unique set of advantages, including real-time adaptability, efficient convergence, and suitability for implementation in hardware environments. By integrating Python and Verilog technologies, this methodology strives to overcome the limitations of existing systems and provide a comprehensive solution for digital audio processing.
 
PROPOSED SYSTEM 

The proposed system involves a multi-faceted approach. First, a Python script converts an audio input into a hexadecimal file, ensuring efficient data representation. Subsequently, the Verilog-based implementation of an LMS filter processes the audio data in real-time. Finally, another Python script converts the filtered output back into an audio file. This system aims to provide insights into the seamless integration of LMS filters into digital audio processing workflows. This section provides a detailed roadmap of the research methodology, outlining the step-by-step processes involved in achieving the research objectives. The most important additives of the proposed device are:

Convert MP3 to Hex (Python);
Objective: Convert MP3 audio files into an 8-bit hexadecimal representation suitable for hardware level processing. Implementation: Utilize the Pydub library in Python to read MP3 files, extract a targeted sample size, convert audio samples to 8-bit hexadecimal, and store the resulting hex values in a text file.

C97 Audio Codec (LMS filter) Implementation (Verilog): 
Objective: Implement an AC97 audio codec with the Least Mean Squares (LMS) filtering capabilities in Verilog to process the hexadecimal audio data. Implementation: Develop three interconnected Verilog modules - 'audio,' 'Filter,' and 'Filter_commands.' The 'audio' module interfaces with the LMS filter AC97 codec, the 'Filter' module handles assembly and disassembly of AC97 frames with filtering operations, and the 'Filter_commands' module initializes the AC97 codec.

Integration and Processing (Top-Level Module): 
Objective: Orchestrate the flow of audio data between Python and Verilog components, facilitating iterative processing. Implementation: Design a top-level Verilog module that interfaces with the Python script, manages clock signals, resets, volume control, and facilitates the seamless flow of processed audio data

Convert Hex to MP3 (Python); 
Objective: Reconstruct processed hexadecimal audio data back into MP3 format for practical use.
Implementation: Develop a Python script that reads processed hexadecimal data from the Verilog implementation, filters out non-hexadecimal samples, converts hex values back to bytes, and reconstructs an AudioSegment. Finally, export the reconstructed AudioSegment as an MP3 file.

BLOCK DIAGRAM: 

In this block diagram, the MP3 to Hex Conversion module in Python starts the process, generating an 8-bit hexadecimal representation of the audio data. This hexadecimal data is then processed through the AC97 Audio Codec Implementation in Verilog, which applies filtering operations and initialization commands. The Top-Level Module manages the flow of audio data between Python and Verilog, allowing for iterative processing. Finally, the Hex to MP3 Conversion module in Python reconstructs the processed data back into an MP3 format, completing the audio processing pipeline.
